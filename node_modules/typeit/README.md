# TypeIt: A jQuery Animated Typing Plugin

### Description
A lightweight jQuery plugin that outputs text like it's being typed. It allows you to type single strings, multiple strings that stack, multiple strings that delete & replace each other, and even HTML tags &amp; entities. You can also loop strings or sets of strings continuously.

### Some of the Perks
* Capable of looping your string(s).
* Features JavaScript fallback / SEO optimization option for your strings.
* Multiple easy ways to set up & initialize.
* Capable of handling several unique instances on a single page.
* By default, handles HTML tags (including your custom classes, ID's, etc.) with ease.
* Supported by jQuery 1.8.0 or higher.
* Lightweight. (~3.5kb, single JavaScript file)

## Getting Started

### Download the Plugin

Get it from this repo, or from the following sources: 

* <strong><a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/jquery.typeit">CDN:</a></strong> Include  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.typeit/3.0.0/typeit.min.js` on your page.
* <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/typeit">npm:</a></strong> Install with `npm install typeit`.

### Prepare to Initialize on Your Site

1. Create an empty HTML element to select. (If you want to have a fallback for users without JavaScript, you can put a string or strings right into this element. More on that later.)

  ```<span class="type-it"></span>```

2. Load jQuery and typeit.js on your page.

  ```
  <script src="jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
  <script src="typeit.js"></script>
  ```

You're ready to start typing!

## Usage

### Calling TypeIt on Your Site

You can modify the options for the plugin in two different ways -- either by inserting them directly into the function call, or by using data-* attributes.

#### About Using Settings Object
* When using a single string, you can just wrap it in quotation marks (or in an array; it doesn't matter). 
* When using multiple strings, it's recommended that you place them in an array (Ex: `strings: ['String #1','String #2']`). You can optionally place them in quotation marks, separated by `<br>` tags, however.

Example:

  ``
   <span class="type-it"></span>
  ``

 ```
  $('.type-it').typeIt({
    strings: 'Enter your string here!',
    speed: 300,
    lifeLike: false,
    cursor: true
  });
  ```

#### About Using Data-* Attributes
* Make sure the names are all lowercase. 
* When using multiple strings, wrap your array of strings inside single quotation marks. Ex: `data-typeit-strings='["string #1", "string #2"]'`

Example:

  ```
  <span class="type-it"
  data-typeit-strings="A new string to type."
  data-typeit-speed="100"
  data-typeit-lifelike="true"
  data-typeit-cursor="true">

  </span>
  ```

  ``
  $('.type-it').typeIt();
  ``

You can also define what to type a third way -- by simply filling the element with a string or strings of text. This is convenient because if a user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, they'll still be able to read the text, and the text will be available for SEO purposes. **Note: by default, the plugin will use the string that's in the element. If strings are defined either in the function call or data-* attributes, they will be overridden.**

  ```
  <span class="type-it">This is the string that will be typed.</span> 
  ```

### Typing Multiple Strings

Aside from simply typing a single string, you can configure TypeIt to type multiple strings. If you define your strings within your HTML element, just separate them with `<br>` tags:

  ```
  <span class="type-it">Here is a string. <br>And here is another!</span> 
  ```
If they're defined in the settings object, it's possible to put them inside quotation marks separated by `<br>` tags, but it's recommended that you use an array:

```
  $('.type-it').typeIt({
    strings: ['Enter your string here!', 'Another string!']
  });
```

By default, multiple strings will stack on top of each other (breakLines = true). However, you can also set them to delete and replace each other:

```
  $('.type-it').typeIt({
    strings: ['Enter your string here!', 'Another string!'],
    breakLines: false
  });
```
### Handling HTML Tags
TypeIt will handle HTML tags in your strings, as long as they're only one level deep: 

```
  // GOOD! :)
  $('.typeit-box').typeIt({
    strings: '<h1 class="your-class">This is a string!</h1>',
  }
```

```
  // BAD! :(
  $('.typeit-box').typeIt({
    strings: '<h1 class="your-class"><span>This is a string!</span></h1>',
  }
```

And it'll also handle HTML entities: 

```
  $('.typeit-box').typeIt({
    strings: '<h1 class="your-class">One thing &amp; another!<h1>',
  }
```

To disable all HTML rendering, set 'html' to false.

### Using a Callback Function

TypeIt allows you to use a custom callback function when you've completed typing. To use one, simply add it as the second argument when it's initialized. **Note: if you've enabled `loop`, this is useless.**

```
  $('.typeit-box').typeIt({
    strings: 'Here is a string!',
  }, function() {
    console.log('This is your callback function!');
  });
```

## Options

There are a number of options you may use to customize typeIt.

| Option        | Description   | Default Value
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| strings  | The string(s) to be typed.       | 'Your default string.' |
| speed     | The typing speed.             | 100  |
| lifeLike      | Will make the typing pace irregular, as if a real person is doing it.  | true |
| cursor    | Show a blinking cursor at the end of the string(s).  | true  |
| cursorSpeed    | The blinking speed of the cursor.  | 1000  |
| breakLines    | Choose whether you want multiple strings to be printed on top of each other (breakLines = true), or if you want each string to be deleted and replaced by the next one (breakLines = false).  | true  |
| breakDelay    | The amount of time between typing multiple strings.  | 750  |
| startDelay    | The amount of time before the plugin begins typing after initalizing.  | 250  |
| loop    | Have your string or strings continuously loop after completing.  | false  |
| loopDelay    | The amount of time between looping over a string or set of strings again.  | 750  |
| html    | Handle strings as HTML, which will process tags and HTML entities. If 'false,' strings will be typed literally.  | true  |


## Ideas for Improvement?

Let me know! Otherwise, play with it yourself. Gulp is configured to check & minify the JavaScript. In the root of the repo, use these commands to run these default tasks and watch for file changes (make sure Node.js, npm, and Gulp are installed on your computer):

```
npm install
gulp
```
